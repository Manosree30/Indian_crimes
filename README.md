# Crime Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing crime data from multiple cities in India to uncover insights about crime patterns, victim demographics, and case durations. The objective is to use data visualization and statistical analysis to better understand crime trends and factors contributing to case closures.

## Dataset
The dataset contains records of reported crimes with columns such as:
- Report Number
- Date Reported
- Date and Time of Crime Occurrence
- City
- Crime Code and Description
- Victim Age and Gender
- Weapon Used
- Crime Domain (Violent Crime, Other Crime, etc.)
- Police Deployed
- Case Closed status and Date

The data spans multiple years and covers several major Indian cities.

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and converted date strings to datetime objects.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used descriptive statistics and visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to reveal crime distribution.
- Visualizations include frequency of crimes by city, crime domains, and case duration distributions.
- Statistical Analysis: Calculated metrics such as skewness in case durations.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
- SciPy for statistical tests

## Results
- Identification of top cities with the highest number of crimes.
- Insights into case durations and factors influencing timely closures.
- Visualization of crime categories and weapon usage patterns.
